If the number is divisible by 3, the program will replace the number with "fizz"
If the number is divisible by 5, the program will replace the number with "buzz"
If the number is divisible by bothm the program will replace the number with "fizzbuzz"
If the number cannot be divided at all, then the program will instead output the number.
